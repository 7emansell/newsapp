# _The New Yorker_ Technical Test (Emma Mansell)

Welcome to my technical test. This is a simple React app that renders a front-end client and interacts with NewsAPI. 

## Setting it up

You will need **[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)** and **[Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)**. 

You will also need to get your own API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).
Clone the repo and add a 'config.js' file in [/src](/src).
The contents of this file should just be your API key:

```
export const API_KEY = "yourkey";
```


Once that's set up and you're in the repo, run:

```
nvm use
npm install
npm run start
```

The site should run locally at http://localhost:8080/.
